Please go out and vote for whichever candidate checks all those boxes for you. It doesn’t matter if that’s Sanders, Warren, Biden, or anyone else running. JUST VOTE. 

When it comes to the GE, however, I just hope that everyone remembers that we must weigh pragmatism vs idealism. Yes, we would all like our ideal candidate to go against Trump. But that’s not how our elections work, and the two-party system is the system we have to work with. There are no moral or emotional victories in protest voting or abstaining from voting; not when migrant children are sleeping in cages at the border, not when back-door deals are made to pad the pockets of the ultra-rich, not when taxpayers are strapped with paying for golfing trips and military parades, not when the makeup of the Supreme Court is at stake, and not when vital agency positions are given to players hell-bent on tearing down the very functions and foundations of our government. 

Unless you can convince yourself that you are fine with these things happening, it is disingenuous and hurtful to throw your vote away to “prove a point.” Voting out Trump means voting for WHOEVER the Dem candidate running against him is.

Four years ago, my mother was an obnoxious Trump supporter. So obnoxious in fact that I had to go low contact with her for the first few months following election day and had considered cutting off contact for about a year because she was constantly throwing his win in my face and seemed to deliberately pick fights around Trump and politics.

Well, about 2ish year ago her tune began to change. She said that Trump needed to stop tweeting so much and that he was just constantly sounding like an ass. Slowly but surely she actually seemed to start to dislike the man and was almost as disturbed by the things he said than I was. She eventually said that she just wasn't going to vote at all and I pointed out to her periodically through our conversations the kind of destructive things he was doing, regardless if she agreed with Biden or his policies.

Well, this morning she seemed to make a sudden turn I never expected. She said she was tired of the division that Trump was causing in the country and the hate he was constantly spouting and the only way to stop him was to vote against him. She is going to vote for Biden.

Wow. I never thought it would happen and I thought she would be grasping onto this life raft for the rest of her life until she drowned in the stupidity that Trump seems to represent and attract. But I can proudly say that she didn't let political party history influence her or refuse to admit when she was wrong. So proud!

In a 397-page [opinion](https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/inline-files/18-CVS-14001_Final-Judgment.pdf?Bwsegeo1VV20zhJsp9hoClvmoRp3A6AR), the court has given the General Assembly **two weeks** to redraw both maps - and the redraw will occur under judicial scrutiny.

An appeal is likely, but if granted it would go to the state Supreme Court, as this is a matter under the state constitution.

This brings us one big step closer to having a state legislature that actually reflects the political will of the state - and, hopefully, ending gerrymandering once and for all via constitutional amendment.

I've been in the state legislature for about five years and this is the single best news I've ever heard.

0,Trump's congressional allies are waging open and all out warfare on F.B.I. to free him from the Russia investigation which is about to conclude with a conviction of their president for total "Obstruction of Justice" on 32 counts. Go figure !,407,8via7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/8via7p/trumps_congressional_allies_are_waging_open_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/8via7p/trumps_congressional_allies_are_waging_open_and/,1530563805.0,Yes, as per an article in today's NYT called "Trump's Rage Junkies" by Charles Blow, the famed columnist has reminded us once again that the Republicans in congress are thoroughly frustrated and totally desperate to end the Russia inquiry right now instead of before the end of September which everyone believes will happen.

For these crooked Republican congress members that timing will be completely lethal for their chances of salvaging any votes in the upcoming midterm elections to be held all over America on November 6th.

So no wonder these wretched and low life Americans from the right are doing everything in their power to scuttle the Russia inquiry by yelling, ridiculing and cussing Rod Rosenstein, a Republican whom Trump appointed as the Deputy Attorney General.

And when Mr. Rosenstein is trying to do the right thing to allow Mr. Mueller, another Republican appointed by the Republicans in congress, to finish his inquiry which already nailed 16 Trump campaign connected individuals for corruption and lying to the F.B.I., Republican house member Trey Gowdy of South Carolina lashed out at our Deputy AG saying "Finish the hell up" as per the same article by Mr. Blow

But the main theme of Mr. Blow's article was Trump's ultra racist behaviors.

As we've all seen by now that Trump who unlike most of us, became a total racist from his childhood.

And it was quite easy for Trump to be racist because the way Trump's father Fred Trump filled up the brain of a young Trump with stories of how he harassed and lynched young and old Black folks with the help of his friends, when all of them were members in KKK.


So it's no wonder that Trump grew up being a total racist human being without any remorse.

He also won his election without being apologetic for uttering all the nasty words that he used to be popular among his thoroughly racist followers who helped him in getting elected because they thought they found their long lost messiah.

Living in the countryside without any proper schools and no colleges,his White hard core supporters were always burning with desires to topple a government which was turning diverse right in front of their eyes.

Trump who studied these racist Americans' behaviors for quite some time realized that given a few words against Mexicans,Muslims and Black and Brown immigrants coming from Haiti and other African countries,the countries he referred to as "shithole" countries and quickly denied saying that, so that he could turn the Democrats attending that meeting as liars.

Actually he does all that with a wink to his White Supremacists supporters living nomadic lifestyles in their countryside not having traveled further than the Tennessee river or the mountain valley pipeline surrounding the Appalachian Trail.

Since his followers never set their foot in any other country and will never do, those White Americans turn into White Nationalists only because of their ignorance.
0,Only way to beat Trump it's just stop speaking his name and just say the Republican party or GOP for any relevant policies. This marks the last time I use his name until after the next election. Join me.,402,9zqk9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9zqk9q/only_way_to_beat_trump_its_just_stop_speaking_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9zqk9q/only_way_to_beat_trump_its_just_stop_speaking_his/,1543025534.0,I think what Omarosa said when being interviewed not too long ago is right. The only way that we stop this man's agenda or stop him being reelected in 2020, is to stop printing his name in mainstream media and start discussing his policies as part of the current GOP or Republican party. I mean that we have to stop printing, saying, covering his every stupid word and thought.

He got elected based on people just repeating his name over the years on tv and no substance. He is now a cult personality of name and nothing else. We know that he can lie cheat and do whatever he wants and his followers don't care so we have to make him irrelevant in order to continue with the Democratic process.

So we have to stop covering every single dumb shit thing he says and just package it in with part of the Republican plan for the country and instead focus the media on Democratic candidates and what they are doing and what their policies are and avoid the actual name at all costs.

This is some Voldemort level shit I understand however I honestly think this is the best way to defeat him permanently and swiftly.

Stop with the name, stop with the brand, stop giving a fuck about him and focus on someone else. Your local senator for example is the best place to start and keep printing stories on them.

Focus on your local people, let's talk about anyone and everything else, just... No more of that name.

The slightest hope of winning being replaced by the feeling of potentially being apart of one the greatest political upsets in American history as the night went on and state by state Trump's chances of winning the presidency increased. I remember the unfamiliar restrained political commentary of the Fox News Election Night team slowly turning more and more confident, and at the same time more and more familiar. I remember the rush of joy I experienced when Trump was called the winner, the exhilaration was so great you would have thought I had won the presidency myself. 

I also remember the days that followed and the creeping sense of despair and dread that had began to pester underneath the surface. I remember donating the Trump/Pence 2020 shirt that my mom got me to goodwill, not wanting to wear it anymore. I remember reality set in. In the coming weeks, I had begun to realize my views did not fit in with anything Trump said. My views didn't actually fit in with the Fox News crew's views. My views were as far from Republican as they could be. 

My views had no place in the Republican Party, truly, they never did. I was Pro-Choice throughout high school, arguing that nobody had the right to police what others chose to do with their bodies. I was pro gay marriage, arguing that it was nobody's business to determine whether or not it was okay for those of the same sex to love each other. Love is love, why does it matter? I asked. I believed that African Americans were being treated unfairly in America, and believed that racism was very much alive, if not emboldened, despite the election of Obama. I believed in Immigrant rights, hated the idea of the wall, and despised the bully tactics Trump used against Hillary. 

And yet, I still voted for him. I still caved into what I had been taught by my grandpa growing up, that the Democrats were the enemy and that the Republicans the heroes, no matter who that Republican was. I have since changed my party, and am now registered as a Democrat. I have since found a home for me and my views. I have since changed where I get my news from Fox to the "failing" NYT, "fake" CNN, and "biased" Atlantic. I regret the decision I made in 2016 to vote for Trump, but it did teach me one thing. It taught me which party I truly belonged to. 

Long Story Short: Due to being indoctrinated at a young age by my family (mainly my grandpa who I still love of course) and due to watching Fox News almost daily with my Grandpa, I had a twisted sense of what was right and what was wrong. I was a Republican because I thought I was SUPPOSED to be a Republican. I thought the Republicans were the party of honesty and of God. I thought the Republicans were the good guys and that the Democrats were evil fakes. I know now how wrong I was and I am sorry for the small part I played in getting us to where we are now.

If the latter happens, **Bernie Sanders** becomes **Chairman** of the **Senate Budget Committee**.

Republicans are *fucking terrified* of that prospect, and every Democrat should be proportionally excited by it.  This election is not just about stopping catastrophe - it is an opportunity to really accomplish something amazing.  The power of the Senate Budget Committee over funding of US government institutions is enormous.

No one as progressive as Sanders has *ever* been Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.  I defy anyone to find an example.  And it is within reach, folks.  Turn out to vote!!

0,Trump has got exactly 6 days to enjoy before his presidency will be in serious trouble. With Mueller's damning report about to be handed to the Dems in the House, Trump should think more about closing his own door than closing the border with Mexico.,190,aal5d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/aal5d4/trump_has_got_exactly_6_days_to_enjoy_before_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/aal5d4/trump_has_got_exactly_6_days_to_enjoy_before_his/,1546118290.0,With 50+ subpoenas already sent to the White House by Democrat Elijah Cummings, the Chair-Elect of the House Oversight Committee, Trump should be more concerned about how he'll wriggle himself out of this riddle of staying out of jail for possible collusion with Russia than closing the border with Mexico for lack of $5 billion from U.S. taxpayers that he always said in his campaign, " Mexico will pay for it." 

We also heard him saying something like this in all his campaigns, " Yes, as your president, I'll force Mexican govt. to pay for that damn wall, be sure about that."

And now with neither the congress nor Mexico is ready to pay him the money for the wall, part of which may end up in his campaign coffers, Trump is hellbent on demanding the same money again and again from the leaders of the Democratic party in Congress.

That is exactly what Annie Karni and Nicholas Fandos wrote in their Op-Ed in NYT today titled, "Trump Threatens to Close Border If Congress Won't Fund Wall."

Adding my own views to their reporting, I've to say that either Trump doesn't remember or he has no intention to believe that the two Dem leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi told him pointblank in the White House two weeks back that they'd not pay any money for the wall but only for the border security personnel.

To which, we all remember hearing Trump making the following pledges on national tv, "I'll then shut down the govt. And I'll take the blame for it. Be sure that I'll not put the blame on you two."

So now with our government remaining in a shutdown mode, Trump is one step away from turning this country into one of those third world countries where the government hardly functions.

On the contrary, if he really wants this country to function like the way it used to function before he came into power, he should stop thinking about how to win his next election.

Yes, I strongly believe that Trump should start mitigating the pains of the federal workers who'd been furloughed for no fault of their own last week in the latest closure of all the non-emergency government agencies.

And if he thinks that his first two years of office was a cakewalk, Trump should compare the next two years of his presidency with walking on fire.

With Mr. Mueller's report about to hit the capitol with the loudest noises we've ever heard in our lifetime, Trump will be lucky to finish the first month of the next year as a president before the Republicans in congress force him to resign just like what they did with Nixon in 1974.

The GOP was ever-bitter about the New Deal, about America's strong labor unions, and increasingly (and ironically, given its 19th century history) Civil Rights.  They craved power but could only chip away at the towering American society they despised.

But then came Ronald Reagan, proudly contemptuous of this nation's achievements and values, and substituting in their place a bunch of hollow taxidermist rhetoric.  Democrats worked with him despite his nuttery, but it was not mutual.

George HW Bush followed.  Democrats worked with him - it was not mutual either.  But seemingly to their own surprise, Democrats retook the White House from HW Bush, and waited for Republicans to work with the Clinton administration.  Nope.  It was all-out propaganda war from Day One.

They blocked appointments by default, spewed unhinged lies through their radio monopolies, and brainwashed their followers to the point where their cultist disciples believed simultaneously that Bill Clinton was (1)a feckless hippie and (2)a raving Communist maniac on the verge of sending the ATF to Waco them.

The loss of 18 soldiers in Somalia was treated as a greater scandal than when Reagan threw away 200 Marines in Beirut - a scandal that barely anyone remembers because Democrats had stood for American interests over partisan gain.

Republicans spent $90 million in taxpayer dollars on a vast, sweeping investigation of every aspect of every life with even the remotest connection to Bill Clinton and found...nothing.  But then years later an intern blew him, so IMPEACHMENT!  Bill's blowjob right up there with Nixon's attempt to overthrow the republic.

But then they rigged a presidential election in 2000, committed more crimes than can be counted in a reasonably-sized post - including torture and starting a war that killed 5,000 Americans - but they refused to even investigate it.  Democrats were completely shut out of it all, and yet even then they were cooperating with these lawless pigs. 

Democratic leaders were using words like "misguided" to describe fucking WAR CRIMES for which enemy generals had been hanged by Allied tribunals in WW2.  They were STILL acting as if they had a partner in government in the GOP, despite constant proof - not evidence, absolute PROOF - to the contrary.

Then Obama is President and the GOP reverses course 180 degrees yet again.  From "it's not illegal if the President does it," they reverted to the "destroying the Democrat is more important than serving America" that they held under Bill Clinton.  Most unhinged campaign of hate ever waged and yet virtually zero scandals held.  

Now they won't even investigate an open traitor who is in blatant violation of even the most plainly-stated rules of the US Constitution.  

Ladies and gentlemen, **there is no Republican Party**.  There is no group of political ideas with that label any longer.  There is a hate group and a criminal syndicate that does not believe in or support the concept of laws, or facts, or rights, and that is what's left of the GOP.

They do not recognize your right to exist, to vote, to speak, to do anything they have not commanded you to do in their own interests.  They are tyrants with no redeeming value, and they have zero worth in this country any longer.

Democrats in office, start governing like you are what you already know you are: What remains of a law-abiding government in the United States of America.

And start treating Republicans like what they are: Nihilistic insurgents and vultures tearing at America's flesh, sneering at America's suffering, and longing for the day when there is no longer a free country looming over them making them feel as inadequate and unworthy as they are.

There is no longer any room for appeasement, and no more time for umpteenth-chances for America's internal antagonists.  Republicans chose sides against this country a long time ago, now just fucking fight them.

And what's more, fight to win.  As if you understand that your own careers are the least of what's at stake.

0,Trump by sending his son-in-law's sister to go to China and sell new condos in New Jersey for $500,000 to the Chinese people under the controversial EB-5 program he extended on the same evening,proved that he'll not stop milking the presidency for him and his extended families.,182,6a4zaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/6a4zaw/trump_by_sending_his_soninlaws_sister_to_go_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/6a4zaw/trump_by_sending_his_soninlaws_sister_to_go_to/,1494360381.0,Ever since Trump set his foot in the White House, he coveted himself and his family members with billions of dollars of windfall by mixing his presidency with his Trump Inc. or Trump Org. or by whatever name you can call this thing of gaming the system just to enrich him and his extended families to the point of no return. 

His screwing up of our political system came to a new horizon when he told his son-in-law Jared Kushner's sister to head first to China and talk about upcoming new apartments in affluent New Jersey towns with the money to be furnished at a rate of 4% interest under the EB-5 program instead of 16% that are being charged by our banks and other lending institutions as per 2 articles in today's NYT.

And to most of these 8,000 affluent Chinese people who were already coming to the U.S.A. by paying $500,000 for visa with very scant scrutiny of their sources of money by our Homeland Security Dept.,Trump's son-in-law's sister pitched her never to be completed Condos and business projects in very affluent and expensive New Jersey towns with only 15 minutes drive from New York.

And the ultra rich Chinese people forked out very easily those $500,000 fees for the same program which Trump extended with an Executive Order in the same evening up to September of this year, after Jared Kushner's sister was already present in the packed Hotel ballroom in Beijing just about ready to start her pitch of selling to the Chinese citizens about how to get the U.S. Citizenship with hardly any background checks just like many of their peers did before by forking out $500,000 each under the very highly critical EB-5 program.

This very controversial program which two Senators want to be scrapped as it didn't do it's main purpose which was to help our distressed towns' people with employment opportunities for at least 10 unemployed American citizens in the totally neglected towns and cities.

But instead of doing just that Trump's family members and other builders are gerimandering the towns and cities to include only the rich enclaves in the system to build highly expensive condos and apartments which was never the intention when this program was introduced in 1990.

Just the fact that Trump and his extended family members are trying to build highly expensive apartments and expensive businesses in very affluent New Jersey towns employing hardly any poor people, shows very clearly to us all about the length to which Trump and his family members will go to make a fast buck in the range of $50 million by taking full advantage of his power of the presidency . 

It should be pointed out here that Jared Kushner's sister Ms. Nicole Meyer even used her brother's name and his position and high influence in the White House to sell her pitch along with the picture of his father in law to prove his blessings for the project by repeatedly showing Trump's picture on a huge projection screen in the same Ballroom to bolster her presentation.

In other words she told the attendees in that room that her brother's father-in-law Trump the current president sitting in the White House's Oval room is totally involved in this scam.

And lo and behold, before she could even open her mouth she collected promises with advance money in the range of $50 million total from each of her two pitches first in Beijing and then in Shanghai from those Chinese people who want to settle in the United States with their illegal loot from China the country where they could be languishing in jails for making money from illegal sources and also for not paying any taxes on their illegal and scam filled businesses with undeclared income just like what Trump is doing here in U.S. 

So as we're watching this terrible 'conflict of interest' that Trump is engaging sitting in the White House, we can only look at his presidency with awe as to how a President could use his bully pulpit to make gazillions of dollars by just twisting or extending the laws and regulations that can only help him and his extended family's interests.

So if he really gets his wish of continuing to be the president for 8 years for which he already submitted the paperwork for 2020 presidential election, there will be no other billionaires on this earth who can surpass or even touch his wealth portfolio ever.

With 382+ registered businesses registered in his name in 60+ different countries of this world with another 100+ businesses that he's operating in his buddies and family members' names, his very high stake gamble of winning the presidency by screwing up the minds of innocent and vulnerable poor White citizens of this country whom he promised in all his campaign stops that if he ever became the president with their votes, he'd create jobs only for them first by putting their interests first before his billionaire buddies.

But now with his bunch of billionaire buddies in his cabinet and his followers still without jobs because of his reluctance to close down his businesses in poor countries, its high time his voters wake up from their slumber and face the reality that they've been duped by this con man and the snake oil salesman.

Yes, if his followers still do not realize that they've been taken for a ride, then only God can help them.

Not Trump.

Who to my mind and many other citizens of this country will be the first Trillionaire of this world if we allow him to continue to function as the president of our great country any longer.

Impeachment is the only way our politicians can stop this menace to our societies.

Additionally, health experts suspect new waves of the virus to come through (they could be wrong). That means the likelihood is the elections in November will be altered dramatically. Mail in voting will be the best option available but a reeling post office won’t be able to deliver so the Trump administration and congress will move to keep in person voting thus crippling turnout except for this among us that believe this is a hoax (largely Trump supporters) and ensuring another four years of this garbage.

0,Reminder to Democrats, it’s not enough to vote for Joe Biden. You have to enthusiastically support him through the campaign, or you’ll cost him more votes than the one you give him, just like Hillary in 2016.,155,i5nwli,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/i5nwli/reminder_to_democrats_its_not_enough_to_vote_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/i5nwli/reminder_to_democrats_its_not_enough_to_vote_for/,1596869189.0,In 2016, many liberal Americans voted for Hillary Clinton but also spent the whole election complaining about her, talking trash about her, saying she was just as bad as Trump, calling her lesser of two evils, saying “we’re screwed no matter who wins” ...

...only to then be shocked when Donald Trump won. That’s because these voters cost Hillary more votes than the one they gave her.

I’ve been seeing some of this mentality about Joe Biden ever since it became clear he was going to be the nominee. Liberals and Democrats have been complaining about him, saying they’ll vote for him, but they’re not crazy about him or how they’ll settle for him. It’s not as bad as with Hillary, but it’s still there.

I do not give a damn if Joe Biden is not the ideal candidate for you. I don’t care if you hate him with the passion of a thousand burning suns. You still vote for him, and you enthusiastically support him through the campaign. Why? Because no matter how less than perfect Biden is, he is still INFINITELY better than Trump. 

I wasn’t crazy about Hillary in 2016 either, but I still gladly voted for her and encouraged as many people as I could to vote for her. Why? Because I wasn’t really thinking about her. I was thinking more about the millions of underprivileged and marginalized Americans who would have benefitted tremendously from her progressive policies, which is the same reason I’m gladly voting for Biden. It’s fine if you don’t like him, but you don’t get to claim that you support and care about underprivileged people while also complaining about the candidate whose policies will help them.

So if you’re voting for Biden, do not also spend the whole election complaining about him and still expect him to win.

For the longest time I thought I was a liberal. I thought liberals cared about people and were logical, that's not the case in my experience. As soon as George Floyd died any piece of logic the liberal party had left was thrown into the wind. These people don't want to solve problems they want to blame people. My father's dad was a  black man who grew  up in Arkansas, he encountered racism and it never slowed him down, he never used it as an excuse. He was a Korean war veteran and after his duty, he worked and provided for his family. He made enough to buy a house and send my father to private school. He made something for himself during the time when it was hard as a black man to do so.

When I see black people today crying racism,  it mocks my grandfather, my grandmother and every single person who worked to show America that blacks are equal. Now being equal isn't enough. We demand special treatment from the police i.e. Nothing should happen to us if we try to escape arrest because racist cops! Corporations and celebrities treat us like small brain proto-humans who can't take a blackface joke and even the Democratic Presidential nominee feels he can decide who is black or not based on who they vote for in the election. I am so sick of this BS. Black people have it better than ever before, but we continue to play victim and ask for handouts that destroy us. Single parent homes are the number one threat that is tearing the black community apart. No one says this on television no one wants to be viewed as a racist. It's sad. The men  in my life taught me to work for things, to never make excuses and to critically think. If I didn't have them in my life I probably would be marching and living a lie. 73% of black kids are born out of wedlock. Kids need adults in their life to teach them morals and values. People praise single mothers but should we be? These are adults who make decisions and then we as a country have to pay for these decisions not in just taxes, but our societal foundation. We enable single moms to keep having kids, those kids grow up without moral character and they perpetuate the cycle.

EDIT

Thanks for the comments and medals. I wrote this in a burst of frustration after months of feeling more than a little irritated about BLM. Wish I worded it a bit better, explained somethings, but I'm not going to, thanks guys and gals. I appreciate it.

I've been browsing this sub and r/politics. It blows my mind how much of an echo chamber r/politics is. Anyone who supports the Right, no matter how minimumly, is downvoted, insulted, and probably receive nasty DMs.

They refer to r/conservative from time to time, saying they're losing their minds over there, they're delusional or whatever.

I have seen a lot of civil discussion here. Even when disregarding the left or Biden, you guys don't do it in an insulting way. Which is ironic because the people in r/politics would claim that's all the right does, and yet most of what I see is the complete opposite. It appears that the people who support Trump, or Conservatives, or republicans, get attacked constantly. I don't understand why anybody should be insulted for their political views, no matter what side they're on. 

Anyway I guess what I'm saying is, keep it up guys. I've been lurking this sub for the last month, and I feel like I have a different perspective about Conservatives than I did before I came here. You guys are not as nuts as the media and r/politics makes you guys out to be. That is all.

For some reason I can't see that on my phone.  Thank you so much, I appreciate the gesture but ask you consider using your money elsewhere rather than support reddit. <3 

Hi all.  Firstly, I want to thank you all for having such a great community here.  I found this sub only a few months ago when I was in a fairly bad place mentally, but seeing all the sane, rational people here has really helped me center myself.  So thank you for that.  

I also wanted to share my story a bit, if that's alright!  I've always considered myself a libertarian, seeing as I'm more socially liberal but more small government and fiscally conservative.   But I admit, social issues weighed more heavily for me in my decisions on who to vote for.  I voted for Obama in my first election, and I wrote in for Bernie last time.  Truth be told, I was always afraid of Republicans because of some of the party positions on social issues.  When Trump first ran, I was skeptical.  Figured him for a corporate fat cat looking to stroke his ego by getting the highest position in the country.  I was wrong.  This year, I not only voted for Trump, I voted a straight Republican ticket.  

I've never been full blown TDS, I don't think.  I never liked him.  He said some really offensive things the first time around.  I partook in the women's march in DC after he was elected.  But I also knew that I wouldn't regret not voting for the other person if he won.  What would be, would be.  I had friends who broke down sobbing hysterically when he was elected.   I also had friends who voted for him.  For the most part, I didn't understand either of them but I respected them regardless of what I thought of all that.  

I am a millennial.  I am a woman.  I am a feminist.  I am Hispanic.  I work in big tech.   And I'm pretty damn glad I was completely wrong about Trump.  It was pretty wild for me when at some point earlier this year, I found myself not only in agreement with President Trump, but actively pinning my hopes for the future on him.  2020 has been bizarre.  For me, one of the biggest things I think I've realized is that politics should never be a personality contest.  Duh, no brainier right?  I guess there's something to be said about being young and dumb, lol.  I don't like a lot of what Trump says, but I can't argue with results and that's why I was thrilled to vote for him this year.  

Anyway, thanks for indulging me.  And thank you for creating such a welcoming community for outsiders like me.  I can honestly say it's been a life saver during all this to know there are people calling out the BS going on right now.   Be safe today and make sure to vote!  KAG!

Edit: 
Thank you so much everyone for all the great comments and support!  I'm a little overwhelmed by how big this got, but quite heartened.  Cheers!

Edit:
I've replied to some comments here and there, but there's no way I can look through all of them.  Here are some common questions I see.

* What changed your mind about voting for Trump? 

I didn't include that in the original post because I didn't think people would care all that much and it was already kind of long, but I'm happy to share.  In short, he has a track record now. The first time he ran, I was convinced he was in it to line his pockets and inflate his ego.

I did respect that he chooses to give part of his salary back to the US, and that is probably what first changed my perception of him. But getting rid of the health care mandate was probably the first thing that actually affected me (that I noticed or cared about), but probably not enough to change my mind. His focus on reopening the economy and sending kids back to school were huge for me. I was very anti lockdown from day one. The stuff that went down with the Goya boycott was incredibly stupid especially since the CEO wasn't even being partisan, just polite, and Trump had just signed an EO to help Hispanic Americans. He had best unemployment rates, and has spoken out against the rioters and looters. I've always been pro open borders but in the last couple of years, I've heard some compelling arguments why the measures he's taken against illegal immigration are beneficial to Americans, so I now consider it one of my fence/undecided issues, but I greatly approve of the America first approach. The fact that he negotiated 3 peace deals with the Middle East is amazing and hasn't gotten us into another war is another wonderful point I approve of.  Oh, and the denouncing of the white privilege reeducation stuff.  I saw some of that and was disgusted.  Anyone who says hard work is a "white" trait is off their rocker.  So yeah... There's been a lot. Much more, I'm sure, but I've only been paying attention not as long as I should have...

* Okay but why mention your gender and ethnicity? 

Moreso to defeat the narrative that only straight white men support Trump. I saw some other posts about other women who voted Trump and it made me feel more included, especially since the "everyone on reddit is a guy" lol. I think seeing people you can relate to in a group makes you more likely to join or participate that group, and in the case of the two parties, if Democrats become aware they're losing their "core" base, one can hope they'll be forced to reposition themselves in a way that's more favorable to everyone.

* You're a fake. 

No, I use alt accounts and delete my post history.  Believe what you want, no skin off my back.

1,Reddit has a left-wing terrorist problem: When you are advocating civil war, overthrowing the government, assassinating the President and making common cause with Stalin...you are a terrorist group no matter what you call yourself.,2563,gup7l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/gup7l8/reddit_has_a_leftwing_terrorist_problem_when_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/gup7l8/reddit_has_a_leftwing_terrorist_problem_when_you/,1591062541.0,If you are walking down the street in Portland and unrest breaks out and someone pops you in the nose, can they excuse their violence by saying, "I'm antifa!"  If they popped you in the nose, does that make you a fascist?  This is how antifa wants it.  For too long, reddit has coddled its violent left-wing communities.  It's not The_Donald out there rioting, burning things and shooting people and cops.

And we here on conservative subreddits have watched this happen for so long.  The scumbag left gets its share of tolerance, but the moment a poster here says, "If someone comes on my property and tries to harm me or my family, I will defend my home and loved ones..."  Someone hits the, "threatens or harasses" report reason.  

But today there's a top post on the antifa subreddit.  And it's a hum dinger.  The revolutionary terrorists are mad that the President said that they are terrorists.  And they go on to SHOW us all that they ARE terrorists with "terrorist privilege".  

I guess today is "tolerate a terrorist" day.  But any further tolerance of this is reddit tolerating terrorists every day.  Well *some* terrorists.

This is a bit of a deep dive and it's a boring effort-post.  It's not a snappy meme or short article about things.  I hope you'll join me as I show you what we are dealing with, because I'm seeing boomer talking heads on TV saying, *"I have no idea where all of these miscreants on the streets came from!"*  That's because they've missed all the slicey boi Robespierre wannabes that have been calling for blood running down the streets of the USA for YEARS now.  That's right, that Dew-swilling, tendie muncher who used to satisfy him/herself by snidely typing "America delenda est" on the internet and using the Red World mod while playing Kaiserreich is on the streets now.

And they WANT you to know who they are all while recoiling that the President said that they are a terrorist group.  The left was VERY KEEN to have the DOJ investigating "right-wing terror" in the USA.  They assured us that it's the only **legit** terror in the USA.  Otherwise why would the DOJ be investigating it?  Well, it's time for the spotlight of justice to shine on these left-wingers who want communist revolution and destruction.  Fair's fair, Che.  Time to pay attention to the psychos behind the soy curtain.

Let's look first at [the original post on the antifa subreddit.](https://imgur.com/a/ohUdMfg)

>I am an academic who teaches and studies the rise and fall of Fascism. I am literally anti-fascist by trade. 

Argument from authority.  "Guys, I literally teach this stuff!"  Yes, Karl, no one's shocked that academia is full of leftism.  We've known for awhile.  It doesn't make you any smarter than anyone else.  Of course, our beloved professor immediately brings up Hitler.  

>"It became illegal to be associated with the Communist party. "

I'm not a fan of commies.  Not a fan of Nazis, either.  I think the government needs eyeballs on anyone associated with either of these political philosophies.  What about you?

>Declaring the loose concept of being against Fascism to be terrorism is like what Hitler, did but skips several of the steps. We all know how it ends. We aren't even starting in February. We are starting in March.

Trump isn't declaring the philosophy of "being against fascism" against the law.  If he was...most of our politicians would go to jail.  Because I can't think of any declared "fascist" among them.  Opposing communism isn't fascism.  It's common sense.

>This man can't be allowed to stay in office. If he does. If this movement loses momentum. The people of the United States aren't the only ones who lose. Everyone loses. The world loses. 

(Our OP is going to make it clear later that he is calling for us to get rid of Trump *by any means*...)

>Get out there. Get angry. Don't back down. For all our sakes. Please, don't back down.

(We have riots happening.  This "professor" who spells center "centre" later on is egging on these riots.  Why is reddit allowing a foreigner to encourage rioting in the USA?)

>Nixon resigned under protests, Mubarak was listed in Egypt after the Arab Spring, Marie Antoinette was beheaded and Mussolini was strung up by protestors at a gas station.

>There's more than one way to skin a cat. Vote, but be ready when the election is an inevitable sham.

#This is **inexcusable** reddit.  

#Ban this subreddit, already.  This foreign professor is encouraging violent revolution and encouraging killing our President.  ENOUGH REDDIT!

This is bad...yeah? But the comments DEVOLVE all of this further.  I will put the shots of ALL the comments at the end of the post, but let's just look at SOME of them.

["We are all Jacobins when the last moderate falls. Revolution or death." "haha guillotine go zoom".](https://imgur.com/a/YbfmvHB)

#It was called the "Reign of Terror" for a reason.  So when you are invoking it, don't be surprised when we all call you terrorists...

[Fight fascism with people's war!  Elections no!  People's war yes!](https://imgur.com/a/TzGUnM8)

This is a declaration of civil war.  And it's upvoted!

[Here's where they say that they are "good" with Stalin.  Making common cause with Stalinists is fine and, in fact, if you criticize Stalinists on the antifa subreddit your comment will be removed because you are "causing leftist infighting."](https://imgur.com/a/0KrsZ4t)

["Biden is not anti-fascism."](https://imgur.com/a/wZvpx5Z)

These people will not even be satisfied if Biden wins.  Do you understand yet?  It's not TRUMP that they oppose at all.  They oppose capitalism.  They are upset that Biden's campaign doesn't embrace socialism.  These are not anti-fascists...these are violent left-wing revolutionaries and they are announcing as much while also pretending to be offended that the nation has noticed.

[RED FOREVER!  STAY STRONG COMRADES!](https://imgur.com/a/RMUuSzo)

You think this is a larp, but that account has a three year history of posting lefty shit on reddit.

[This is very important.  Here is our OP noting that Trump was "taken to a bunker" and saying that he's NOT "talking about voting."  Our OP...is encouraging the masses to take out Trump...and if this isn't getting dodgy enough...](https://imgur.com/a/IB56SUk)

[Another poster says, "Assassination is always an option..."](https://imgur.com/a/PAA0W2K)

This comment is still there and has been up for two hours now.

#So reddit, are you good with all of this?  Having the antifa subreddit feature a post that calls for civil war, killing the President, overthrowing the government and uniting Stalinists with the rest of the left to form a new revolutionary government that will use guillotines?

God help us.

He straight up admits he is actively lying to the American people to win as well! I thought this guy was a reformer, who claimed he would run the most transparent administration ever!

Social media has become toxic these days - with friends posting things to support the black lives matter movement. I agree with the motive of this movement, but it just feels like everyone is hopping on this bandwagon just to feel like they’re contributing and because it’s trending now. 

I’m seeing posts from people saying things like “we see you people who aren’t posting anything on social media. We see that you dont care about black lives or anything going on now.”  But like what are YOU doing? You’re sitting on your lazy ass shaming other people while there are REAL people protesting and trying to make a change. Sharing a facebook post isn’t contributing to shit, sorry for my language. I’m so sick and tired of this leftist elite culture and that you HAVE to be a certain way to be accepted by them. The left is supposed to be the most “accepting and encouraging” environment, yet they so easily punish their own friends for NOT POSTING A BLACK SQUARE OR MORE ON SOCIAL MEDIA? Sorry but this makes me so mad and I’m sure others are too. The left is so good at guilt shaming others for not following the trends. 

I considered myself a democrat/ left leaning for so many years. These recent events were the last straw for me. Seeing how the democratic party is taking advantage of its voters once again during election year is appalling. I’m sick and tired of the bullshit left and my eyes are opened. 

Yours truly,

I'm single. I left home in my teens to live with an older sibling who has a long term(which was not diagnosed at that time) autoimmune disorder and had just given birth to her eldest child. For half a year I stayed home and tended her child while she attended university(homeschooled myself during this time.), then she went to live in another state to continue attending school and it was just me, the child, and their father. I went to high school, and worked part time, and helped raise this child for another year. 

I ADORE this child, and she adores me, but this experience dealing with her parents made me realize very early in life that I didn't want children of my own. I feel like her parents were very entitled, selfish, and ultimately abusive to both me and my niece.

**This experience basically made me NEVER want to be dependent upon anyone ever again** and I saw that getting into most relationships, pursuing most career goals put me into this position, regardless of what I was bringing to the table. I basically started working and haven't really stopped since then.

Despite struggling, I'm pretty much able to get by because I've always been willing to work hard and I don't have any children it's just me, but I've not really thrived. I worked a lot of jobs in various industries but I've not moved up in income or title.

 There was a time when I considered university education(mainly because that's what was pushed to me.) Now I'm seriously considering trade school if I do decide to further my education.  

I did consider and dismiss both joining the armed services and pursuing a CDL license simply because, as I said, I am a single woman, and I did not trust going off somewhere far away from my male relatives around a bunch of strange men who don't have regular access to women. Seems like a recipe for...basically all of the sexual assault/harassment you hear about women in those environments experiencing and I've never been willing to take that chance.  Same thing with marriage or romantic relationships. I basically know that I'm not a position that society respects or values( even some of my own family members have shown me this.) and I don't trust any strangers to protect my interests/safety like I will. And I'm not going to be stupid enough to put myself in a position that I can't get out of by myself. 

Experience has basically proved me right in this regard since ALL of the women I know personally who followed these paths did experience/are experiencing both sexual assault/harassment/abuse in addition to the career/economic benefits. More power to them, just could not be me. I'm sure they feel the same about my life. So it is what it is.

I don't think I've ever really had personal politics, at least I didn't recognize them as such, until I moved to a different region of the United States. I moved from the Midwest, a very conservative part of the Midwest, to very "liberal" NYC. Mainly to pursue my own personal interests which are easier to do here than where I was living. I experienced culture shock. Which I expected but not in the ways/areas I experienced it.

These are just my experiences in regards to Liberals VS Conservatives and why one state which is supposedly so prejudiced and Conservative was actually more accepting and progressive than the Liberal one.

**Liberals LIE. All the time. For no reason, or any reason.** This makes them very hard to deal with on a day to day to basis. And I'm quite personally at a point where I'm fed up with it. For one thing, the lies just get compounded over time(because actions have consequences.) and since they never own up to them, the consequences of said lies are never dealt with get worse over time. Being an honest person here is basically like being an adult in a world full of small children. Conservatives get angry when you lie to them, whereas Liberals get angry when you tell them the truth. I'm DEAD serious here. It can be over something trivial or something serious but try having an honest discussion with a Liberal about anything, not even something political. At best it will end in some emotional outburst, at worst they will try to attack you in some way, at some point simply because you said or thought something they disagreed with. Which brings me to my next point

**Liberals are ALL ABOUT CONTROL. They are just naturally TYRANNICAL.** 

I don't like saying that it's their belief system, but it is. Conservatives simply draw boundaries about what they will and won't do or accept. Liberals don't accept anything that doesn't align with their beliefs, even if their beliefs/or what they are based on is proven wrong. I'm gonna bring up the elephant in the room: The Pandemic. I pointed out to someone that Sweden hasn't instituted lockdowns, or mask mandates and their Covid Infection rates aren't any worse than any other country in Europe. The answers that I got were, "You don't know that." Even after I showed articles that said this very thing. Then it was, "Its a very small country." Which has nothing to do with the supposed communicability of this disease. Then it was, "Well Swedish people are more healthy." Which honestly speaks to my experience. Every person I know who was infected with Covid-19 had a preexisting condition. It was only five people for me but still. I'm hardly a picture of health but due to my "deplorable" status the jobs I do require a lot of physical labor and I try to eat healthy and don't drink or smoke. So I don't lead a sedentary lifestyle and Precovid I did actually try to go to the gym. But I still deal with health issues most of my illnesses seem to come on from stress and lack of sleep which I recognize as a lifestyle choice. Lifestyle CHOICES. **Masks will not protect you from those.** If you drink soda all day, and never eat vegetables and already have some type of disorder and then get a completely unnecessary vaccination during a pandemic...I'm kinda not surprised you came down with Covid-19. If you're a heavy smoker and lead a sedentary lifestyle...I'm kinda not surprised you got diagnosed with Covid-19. 

But it's the elephant in the room to even point out that not everyone seems to be at equal risk for catching this disease. Because that would be thinking independently and coming to unpleasant conclusions about things like...obesity or the standard American/Western diet/lifestyle that tends to lead to/worsen obesity/chronic illnesses. So...everyone just wear the masks, even though in the beginning of the pandemic we told you not to, and social distance. Meanwhile you can still drink liquor and buy cigarettes and purchase sex from sex workers/have casual sex, but don't you dare go to church or school! 

It just doesn't make sense and it's clearly about controlling people to create **a feeling of safety** rather than actually making things safe. 

I didn't expect this to be this long. Sorry!  But those are probably the two main things. But there are SO MANY more. Its just been adding up. I don't want to get longwinded(even though I have) so I'll just end it here. One of my personal core values is HONESTY. And I really can't abide lying, or liars. I just can't. And I KNOW when I'm being lied to and I don't care how forcefully or vigorously the liar persists. At a certain point you realize who/what you're dealing with and you just stop engaging them and move in silence and I think this election...you're going to witness that.

But that’s not how our elections work, and the two-party system is the system we have to work with. There are no moral or emotional victories in protest voting or abstaining from voting; not when migrant children are sleeping in cages at the border, not when back-door deals are made to pad the pockets of the ultra-rich, not when taxpayers are strapped with paying for golfing trips and military parades, not when the makeup of the Supreme Court is at stake, and not when vital agency positions are given to players hell-bent on tearing down the very functions and foundations of our government. Unless you can convince yourself that you are fine with these things happening, it is disingenuous and hurtful to throw your vote away to “prove a point.” Voting out Trump means voting for WHOEVER the Dem candidate running against him is.

Four years ago, my mother was an obnoxious Trump supporter. So obnoxious in fact that I had to go low contact with her for the first few months following election day and had considered cutting off contact for about a year because she was constantly throwing his win in my face and seemed to deliberately pick fights around Trump and politics.Well, about 2ish year ago her tune began to change. She said that Trump needed to stop tweeting so much and that he was just constantly sounding like an ass. Slowly but surely she actually seemed to start to dislike the man and was almost as disturbed by the things he said than I was. She eventually said that she just wasn't going to vote at all and I pointed out to her periodically through our conversations the kind of destructive things he was doing, regardless if she agreed with Biden or his policies.Well, this morning she seemed to make a sudden turn I never expected. She said she was tired of the division that Trump was causing in the country and the hate he was constantly spouting and the only way to stop him was to vote against him. She is going to vote for Biden.Wow. I never thought it would happen and I thought she would be grasping onto this life raft for the rest of her life until she drowned in the stupidity that Trump seems to represent and attract. But I can proudly say that she didn't let political party history influence her or refuse to admit when she was wrong. So proud!

Go figure !,404,8via7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/8via7p/trumps_congressional_allies_are_waging_open_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/8via7p/trumps_congressional_allies_are_waging_open_and/,1530563805.0,Yes, as per an article in today's NYT called "Trump's Rage Junkies" by Charles Blow, the famed columnist has reminded us once again that the Republicans in congress are thoroughly frustrated and totally desperate to end the Russia inquiry right now instead of before the end of September which everyone believes will happen.For these crooked Republican congress members that timing will be completely lethal for their chances of salvaging any votes in the upcoming midterm elections to be held all over America on November 6th.So no wonder these wretched and low life Americans from the right are doing everything in their power to scuttle the Russia inquiry by yelling, ridiculing and cussing Rod Rosenstein, a Republican whom Trump appointed as the Deputy Attorney General.And when Mr. Rosenstein is trying to do the right thing to allow Mr. Mueller, another Republican appointed by the Republicans in congress, to finish his inquiry which already nailed 16 Trump campaign connected individuals for corruption and lying to the F.B.I., Republican house member Trey Gowdy of South Carolina lashed out at our Deputy AG saying "Finish the hell up" as per the same article by Mr. BlowBut the main theme of Mr. Blow's article was Trump's ultra racist behaviors.As we've all seen by now that Trump who unlike most of us, became a total racist from his childhood.And it was quite easy for Trump to be racist because the way Trump's father Fred Trump filled up the brain of a young Trump with stories of how he harassed and lynched young and old Black folks with the help of his friends, when all of them were members in KKK.So it's no wonder that Trump grew up being a total racist human being without any remorse.He also won his election without being apologetic for uttering all the nasty words that he used to be popular among his thoroughly racist followers who helped him in getting elected because they thought they found their long lost messiah.Living in the countryside without any proper schools and no colleges,his White hard core supporters were always burning with desires to topple a government which was turning diverse right in front of their eyes.Trump who studied these racist Americans' behaviors for quite some time realized that given a few words against Mexicans,Muslims and Black and Brown immigrants coming from Haiti and other African countries,the countries he referred to as "shithole" countries and quickly denied saying that, so that he could turn the Democrats attending that meeting as liars.Actually he does all that with a wink to his White Supremacists supporters living nomadic lifestyles in their countryside not having traveled further than the Tennessee river or the mountain valley pipeline surrounding the Appalachian Trail.Since his followers never set their foot in any other country and will never do, those White Americans turn into White Nationalists only because of their ignorance.
0,Only way to beat Trump it's just stop speaking his name and just say the Republican party or GOP for any relevant policies. This marks the last time I use his name until after the next election. Join me.,406,9zqk9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9zqk9q/only_way_to_beat_trump_its_just_stop_speaking_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9zqk9q/only_way_to_beat_trump_its_just_stop_speaking_his/,1543025534.0,I think what Omarosa said when being interviewed not too long ago is right. The only way that we stop this man's agenda or stop him being reelected in 2020, is to stop printing his name in mainstream media and start discussing his policies as part of the current GOP or Republican party. I mean that we have to stop printing, saying, covering his every stupid word and thought.He got elected based on people just repeating his name over the years on tv and no substance. He is now a cult personality of name and nothing else. We know that he can lie cheat and do whatever he wants and his followers don't care so we have to make him irrelevant in order to continue with the Democratic process.So we have to stop covering every single dumb shit thing he says and just package it in with part of the Republican plan for the country and instead focus the media on Democratic candidates and what they are doing and what their policies are and avoid the actual name at all costs.This is some Voldemort level shit I understand however I honestly think this is the best way to defeat him permanently and swiftly.Stop with the name, stop with the brand, stop giving a fuck about him and focus on someone else. Your local senator for example is the best place to start and keep printing stories on them.Focus on your local people, let's talk about anyone and everything else, just... No more of that name.

The slightest hope of winning being replaced by the feeling of potentially being apart of one the greatest political upsets in American history as the night went on and state by state Trump's chances of winning the presidency increased. I remember the unfamiliar restrained political commentary of the Fox News Election Night team slowly turning more and more confident, and at the same time more and more familiar. I remember the rush of joy I experienced when Trump was called the winner, the exhilaration was so great you would have thought I had won the presidency myself. I also remember the days that followed and the creeping sense of despair and dread that had began to pester underneath the surface. I remember donating the Trump/Pence 2020 shirt that my mom got me to goodwill, not wanting to wear it anymore. I remember reality set in. In the coming weeks, I had begun to realize my views did not fit in with anything Trump said. My views didn't actually fit in with the Fox News crew's views. My views were as far from Republican as they could be. My views had no place in the Republican Party, truly, they never did. I was Pro-Choice throughout high school, arguing that nobody had the right to police what others chose to do with their bodies. I was pro gay marriage, arguing that it was nobody's business to determine whether or not it was okay for those of the same sex to love each other. Love is love, why does it matter? I asked. I believed that African Americans were being treated unfairly in America, and believed that racism was very much alive, if not emboldened, despite the election of Obama. I believed in Immigrant rights, hated the idea of the wall, and despised the bully tactics Trump used against Hillary. And yet, I still voted for him. I still caved into what I had been taught by my grandpa growing up, that the Democrats were the enemy and that the Republicans the heroes, no matter who that Republican was. I have since changed my party, and am now registered as a Democrat. I have since found a home for me and my views. I have since changed where I get my news from Fox to the "failing" NYT, "fake" CNN, and "biased" Atlantic. I regret the decision I made in 2016 to vote for Trump, but it did teach me one thing. It taught me which party I truly belonged to. Long Story Short: Due to being indoctrinated at a young age by my family (mainly my grandpa who I still love of course) and due to watching Fox News almost daily with my Grandpa, I had a twisted sense of what was right and what was wrong. I was a Republican because I thought I was SUPPOSED to be a Republican. I thought the Republicans were the party of honesty and of God. I thought the Republicans were the good guys and that the Democrats were evil fakes. I know now how wrong I was and I am sorry for the small part I played in getting us to where we are now.

If the latter happens, **Bernie Sanders** becomes **Chairman** of the **Senate Budget Committee**.Republicans are *fucking terrified* of that prospect, and every Democrat should be proportionally excited by it.  This election is not just about stopping catastrophe - it is an opportunity to really accomplish something amazing.  The power of the Senate Budget Committee over funding of US government institutions is enormous.No one as progressive as Sanders has *ever* been Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.  I defy anyone to find an example.  And it is within reach, folks.  Turn out to vote!!

0,Trump has got exactly 6 days to enjoy before his presidency will be in serious trouble.

We also heard him saying something like this in all his campaigns, " Yes, as your president, I'll force Mexican govt. to pay for that damn wall, be sure about that."And now with neither the congress nor Mexico is ready to pay him the money for the wall, part of which may end up in his campaign coffers, Trump is hellbent on demanding the same money again and again from the leaders of the Democratic party in Congress.That is exactly what Annie Karni and Nicholas Fandos wrote in their Op-Ed in NYT today titled, "Trump Threatens to Close Border If Congress Won't Fund Wall."Adding my own views to their reporting, I've to say that either Trump doesn't remember or he has no intention to believe that the two Dem leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi told him pointblank in the White House two weeks back that they'd not pay any money for the wall but only for the border security personnel.To which, we all remember hearing Trump making the following pledges on national tv, "I'll then shut down the govt. And I'll take the blame for it. Be sure that I'll not put the blame on you two."So now with our government remaining in a shutdown mode, Trump is one step away from turning this country into one of those third world countries where the government hardly functions.On the contrary, if he really wants this country to function like the way it used to function before he came into power, he should stop thinking about how to win his next election.Yes, I strongly believe that Trump should start mitigating the pains of the federal workers who'd been furloughed for no fault of their own last week in the latest closure of all the non-emergency government agencies.And if he thinks that his first two years of office was a cakewalk, Trump should compare the next two years of his presidency with walking on fire.With Mr. Mueller's report about to hit the capitol with the loudest noises we've ever heard in our lifetime, Trump will be lucky to finish the first month of the next year as a president before the Republicans in congress force him to resign just like what they did with Nixon in 1974.

The GOP was ever-bitter about the New Deal, about America's strong labor unions, and increasingly (and ironically, given its 19th century history) Civil Rights.  They craved power but could only chip away at the towering American society they despised.But then came Ronald Reagan, proudly contemptuous of this nation's achievements and values, and substituting in their place a bunch of hollow taxidermist rhetoric.  Democrats worked with him despite his nuttery, but it was not mutual.George HW Bush followed.  Democrats worked with him - it was not mutual either.  But seemingly to their own surprise, Democrats retook the White House from HW Bush, and waited for Republicans to work with the Clinton administration.  Nope.  It was all-out propaganda war from Day One.They blocked appointments by default, spewed unhinged lies through their radio monopolies, and brainwashed their followers to the point where their cultist disciples believed simultaneously that Bill Clinton was (1)a feckless hippie and (2)a raving Communist maniac on the verge of sending the ATF to Waco them.The loss of 18 soldiers in Somalia was treated as a greater scandal than when Reagan threw away 200 Marines in Beirut - a scandal that barely anyone remembers because Democrats had stood for American interests over partisan gain.Republicans spent $90 million in taxpayer dollars on a vast, sweeping investigation of every aspect of every life with even the remotest connection to Bill Clinton and found...nothing.  But then years later an intern blew him, so IMPEACHMENT!  Bill's blowjob right up there with Nixon's attempt to overthrow the republic.But then they rigged a presidential election in 2000, committed more crimes than can be counted in a reasonably-sized post - including torture and starting a war that killed 5,000 Americans - but they refused to even investigate it.  Democrats were completely shut out of it all, and yet even then they were cooperating with these lawless pigs. Democratic leaders were using words like "misguided" to describe fucking WAR CRIMES for which enemy generals had been hanged by Allied tribunals in WW2.  They were STILL acting as if they had a partner in government in the GOP, despite constant proof - not evidence, absolute PROOF - to the contrary.Then Obama is President and the GOP reverses course 180 degrees yet again.  From "it's not illegal if the President does it," they reverted to the "destroying the Democrat is more important than serving America" that they held under Bill Clinton.  Most unhinged campaign of hate ever waged and yet virtually zero scandals held.  Now they won't even investigate an open traitor who is in blatant violation of even the most plainly-stated rules of the US Constitution.  Ladies and gentlemen, **there is no Republican Party**.  There is no group of political ideas with that label any longer.  There is a hate group and a criminal syndicate that does not believe in or support the concept of laws, or facts, or rights, and that is what's left of the GOP.They do not recognize your right to exist, to vote, to speak, to do anything they have not commanded you to do in their own interests.  They are tyrants with no redeeming value, and they have zero worth in this country any longer.Democrats in office, start governing like you are what you already know you are: What remains of a law-abiding government in the United States of America.And start treating Republicans like what they are: Nihilistic insurgents and vultures tearing at America's flesh, sneering at America's suffering, and longing for the day when there is no longer a free country looming over them making them feel as inadequate and unworthy as they are.There is no longer any room for appeasement, and no more time for umpteenth-chances for America's internal antagonists.  Republicans chose sides against this country a long time ago, now just fucking fight them.And what's more, fight to win.  As if you understand that your own careers are the least of what's at stake.

0,Trump by sending his son-in-law's sister to go to China and sell new condos in New Jersey for $500,000 to the Chinese people under the controversial EB-5 program he extended on the same evening,proved that he'll not stop milking the presidency for him and his extended families.,180,6a4zaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/6a4zaw/trump_by_sending_his_soninlaws_sister_to_go_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/6a4zaw/trump_by_sending_his_soninlaws_sister_to_go_to/,1494360381.0,Ever since Trump set his foot in the White House, he coveted himself and his family members with billions of dollars of windfall by mixing his presidency with his Trump Inc. or Trump Org. or by whatever name you can call this thing of gaming the system just to enrich him and his extended families to the point of no return. His screwing up of our political system came to a new horizon when he told his son-in-law Jared Kushner's sister to head first to China and talk about upcoming new apartments in affluent New Jersey towns with the money to be furnished at a rate of 4% interest under the EB-5 program instead of 16% that are being charged by our banks and other lending institutions as per 2 articles in today's NYT.And to most of these 8,000 affluent Chinese people who were already coming to the U.S.A. by paying $500,000 for visa with very scant scrutiny of their sources of money by our Homeland Security Dept.,Trump's son-in-law's sister pitched her never to be completed Condos and business projects in very affluent and expensive New Jersey towns with only 15 minutes drive from New York.And the ultra rich Chinese people forked out very easily those $500,000 fees for the same program which Trump extended with an Executive Order in the same evening up to September of this year, after Jared Kushner's sister was already present in the packed Hotel ballroom in Beijing just about ready to start her pitch of selling to the Chinese citizens about how to get the U.S. Citizenship with hardly any background checks just like many of their peers did before by forking out $500,000 each under the very highly critical EB-5 program.This very controversial program which two Senators want to be scrapped as it didn't do it's main purpose which was to help our distressed towns' people with employment opportunities for at least 10 unemployed American citizens in the totally neglected towns and cities.But instead of doing just that Trump's family members and other builders are gerimandering the towns and cities to include only the rich enclaves in the system to build highly expensive condos and apartments which was never the intention when this program was introduced in 1990.Just the fact that Trump and his extended family members are trying to build highly expensive apartments and expensive businesses in very affluent New Jersey towns employing hardly any poor people, shows very clearly to us all about the length to which Trump and his family members will go to make a fast buck in the range of $50 million by taking full advantage of his power of the presidency . It should be pointed out here that Jared Kushner's sister Ms. Nicole Meyer even used her brother's name and his position and high influence in the White House to sell her pitch along with the picture of his father in law to prove his blessings for the project by repeatedly showing Trump's picture on a huge projection screen in the same Ballroom to bolster her presentation.In other words she told the attendees in that room that her brother's father-in-law Trump the current president sitting in the White House's Oval room is totally involved in this scam.And lo and behold, before she could even open her mouth she collected promises with advance money in the range of $50 million total from each of her two pitches first in Beijing and then in Shanghai from those Chinese people who want to settle in the United States with their illegal loot from China the country where they could be languishing in jails for making money from illegal sources and also for not paying any taxes on their illegal and scam filled businesses with undeclared income just like what Trump is doing here in U.S. So as we're watching this terrible 'conflict of interest' that Trump is engaging sitting in the White House, we can only look at his presidency with awe as to how a President could use his bully pulpit to make gazillions of dollars by just twisting or extending the laws and regulations that can only help him and his extended family's interests.So if he really gets his wish of continuing to be the president for 8 years for which he already submitted the paperwork for 2020 presidential election, there will be no other billionaires on this earth who can surpass or even touch his wealth portfolio ever.With 382+ registered businesses registered in his name in 60+ different countries of this world with another 100+ businesses that he's operating in his buddies and family members' names, his very high stake gamble of winning the presidency by screwing up the minds of innocent and vulnerable poor White citizens of this country whom he promised in all his campaign stops that if he ever became the president with their votes, he'd create jobs only for them first by putting their interests first before his billionaire buddies.But now with his bunch of billionaire buddies in his cabinet and his followers still without jobs because of his reluctance to close down his businesses in poor countries, its high time his voters wake up from their slumber and face the reality that they've been duped by this con man and the snake oil salesman.Yes, if his followers still do not realize that they've been taken for a ride, then only God can help them.Not Trump.Who to my mind and many other citizens of this country will be the first Trillionaire of this world if we allow him to continue to function as the president of our great country any longer.Impeachment is the only way our politicians can stop this menace to our societies.

Additionally, health experts suspect new waves of the virus to come through (they could be wrong). That means the likelihood is the elections in November will be altered dramatically. Mail in voting will be the best option available but a reeling post office won’t be able to deliver so the Trump administration and congress will move to keep in person voting thus crippling turnout except for this among us that believe this is a hoax (largely Trump supporters) and ensuring another four years of this garbage.

0,Reminder to Democrats, it’s not enough to vote for Joe Biden. You have to enthusiastically support him through the campaign, or you’ll cost him more votes than the one you give him, just like Hillary in 2016.,152,i5nwli,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/i5nwli/reminder_to_democrats_its_not_enough_to_vote_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/i5nwli/reminder_to_democrats_its_not_enough_to_vote_for/,1596869189.0,In 2016, many liberal Americans voted for Hillary Clinton but also spent the whole election complaining about her, talking trash about her, saying she was just as bad as Trump, calling her lesser of two evils, saying “we’re screwed no matter who wins” ......only to then be shocked when Donald Trump won. That’s because these voters cost Hillary more votes than the one they gave her.I’ve been seeing some of this mentality about Joe Biden ever since it became clear he was going to be the nominee. Liberals and Democrats have been complaining about him, saying they’ll vote for him, but they’re not crazy about him or how they’ll settle for him. It’s not as bad as with Hillary, but it’s still there.I do not give a damn if Joe Biden is not the ideal candidate for you. I don’t care if you hate him with the passion of a thousand burning suns. You still vote for him, and you enthusiastically support him through the campaign. Why? Because no matter how less than perfect Biden is, he is still INFINITELY better than Trump. I wasn’t crazy about Hillary in 2016 either, but I still gladly voted for her and encouraged as many people as I could to vote for her. Why? Because I wasn’t really thinking about her. I was thinking more about the millions of underprivileged and marginalized Americans who would have benefitted tremendously from her progressive policies, which is the same reason I’m gladly voting for Biden. It’s fine if you don’t like him, but you don’t get to claim that you support and care about underprivileged people while also complaining about the candidate whose policies will help them.So if you’re voting for Biden, do not also spend the whole election complaining about him and still expect him to win.

For the longest time I thought I was a liberal. I thought liberals cared about people and were logical, that's not the case in my experience. As soon as George Floyd died any piece of logic the liberal party had left was thrown into the wind. These people don't want to solve problems they want to blame people. My father's dad was a  black man who grew  up in Arkansas, he encountered racism and it never slowed him down, he never used it as an excuse. He was a Korean war veteran and after his duty, he worked and provided for his family. He made enough to buy a house and send my father to private school. He made something for himself during the time when it was hard as a black man to do so.When I see black people today crying racism,  it mocks my grandfather, my grandmother and every single person who worked to show America that blacks are equal. Now being equal isn't enough. We demand special treatment from the police i.e. Nothing should happen to us if we try to escape arrest because racist cops! Corporations and celebrities treat us like small brain proto-humans who can't take a blackface joke and even the Democratic Presidential nominee feels he can decide who is black or not based on who they vote for in the election. I am so sick of this BS. Black people have it better than ever before, but we continue to play victim and ask for handouts that destroy us. Single parent homes are the number one threat that is tearing the black community apart. No one says this on television no one wants to be viewed as a racist. It's sad. The men  in my life taught me to work for things, to never make excuses and to critically think. If I didn't have them in my life I probably would be marching and living a lie. 73% of black kids are born out of wedlock. Kids need adults in their life to teach them morals and values. People praise single mothers but should we be? These are adults who make decisions and then we as a country have to pay for these decisions not in just taxes, but our societal foundation. We enable single moms to keep having kids, those kids grow up without moral character and they perpetuate the cycle.EDITThanks for the comments and medals. I wrote this in a burst of frustration after months of feeling more than a little irritated about BLM. Wish I worded it a bit better, explained somethings, but I'm not going to, thanks guys and gals. I appreciate it.

I've been browsing this sub and r/politics. It blows my mind how much of an echo chamber r/politics is. Anyone who supports the Right, no matter how minimumly, is downvoted, insulted, and probably receive nasty DMs.They refer to r/conservative from time to time, saying they're losing their minds over there, they're delusional or whatever.I have seen a lot of civil discussion here. Even when disregarding the left or Biden, you guys don't do it in an insulting way. Which is ironic because the people in r/politics would claim that's all the right does, and yet most of what I see is the complete opposite. It appears that the people who support Trump, or Conservatives, or republicans, get attacked constantly. I don't understand why anybody should be insulted for their political views, no matter what side they're on. Anyway I guess what I'm saying is, keep it up guys. I've been lurking this sub for the last month, and I feel like I have a different perspective about Conservatives than I did before I came here. You guys are not as nuts as the media and r/politics makes you guys out to be. That is all.

For some reason I can't see that on my phone.  Thank you so much, I appreciate the gesture but ask you consider using your money elsewhere rather than support reddit. <3 Hi all.  Firstly, I want to thank you all for having such a great community here.  I found this sub only a few months ago when I was in a fairly bad place mentally, but seeing all the sane, rational people here has really helped me center myself.  So thank you for that.  I also wanted to share my story a bit, if that's alright!  I've always considered myself a libertarian, seeing as I'm more socially liberal but more small government and fiscally conservative.   But I admit, social issues weighed more heavily for me in my decisions on who to vote for.  I voted for Obama in my first election, and I wrote in for Bernie last time.  Truth be told, I was always afraid of Republicans because of some of the party positions on social issues.  When Trump first ran, I was skeptical.  Figured him for a corporate fat cat looking to stroke his ego by getting the highest position in the country.  I was wrong.  This year, I not only voted for Trump, I voted a straight Republican ticket.  I've never been full blown TDS, I don't think.  I never liked him.  He said some really offensive things the first time around.  I partook in the women's march in DC after he was elected.  But I also knew that I wouldn't regret not voting for the other person if he won.  What would be, would be.  I had friends who broke down sobbing hysterically when he was elected.   I also had friends who voted for him.  For the most part, I didn't understand either of them but I respected them regardless of what I thought of all that.  I am a millennial.  I am a woman.  I am a feminist.  I am Hispanic.  I work in big tech.   And I'm pretty damn glad I was completely wrong about Trump.  It was pretty wild for me when at some point earlier this year, I found myself not only in agreement with President Trump, but actively pinning my hopes for the future on him.  2020 has been bizarre.  For me, one of the biggest things I think I've realized is that politics should never be a personality contest.  Duh, no brainier right?  I guess there's something to be said about being young and dumb, lol.  I don't like a lot of what Trump says, but I can't argue with results and that's why I was thrilled to vote for him this year.  Anyway, thanks for indulging me.  And thank you for creating such a welcoming community for outsiders like me.  I can honestly say it's been a life saver during all this to know there are people calling out the BS going on right now.   Be safe today and make sure to vote!  KAG!Edit: Thank you so much everyone for all the great comments and support!  I'm a little overwhelmed by how big this got, but quite heartened.  Cheers!Edit:I've replied to some comments here and there, but there's no way I can look through all of them.  Here are some common questions I see.* What changed your mind about voting for Trump? I didn't include that in the original post because I didn't think people would care all that much and it was already kind of long, but I'm happy to share.  In short, he has a track record now. The first time he ran, I was convinced he was in it to line his pockets and inflate his ego.I did respect that he chooses to give part of his salary back to the US, and that is probably what first changed my perception of him. But getting rid of the health care mandate was probably the first thing that actually affected me (that I noticed or cared about), but probably not enough to change my mind. His focus on reopening the economy and sending kids back to school were huge for me. I was very anti lockdown from day one. The stuff that went down with the Goya boycott was incredibly stupid especially since the CEO wasn't even being partisan, just polite, and Trump had just signed an EO to help Hispanic Americans. He had best unemployment rates, and has spoken out against the rioters and looters. I've always been pro open borders but in the last couple of years, I've heard some compelling arguments why the measures he's taken against illegal immigration are beneficial to Americans, so I now consider it one of my fence/undecided issues, but I greatly approve of the America first approach. The fact that he negotiated 3 peace deals with the Middle East is amazing and hasn't gotten us into another war is another wonderful point I approve of.  Oh, and the denouncing of the white privilege reeducation stuff.  I saw some of that and was disgusted.  Anyone who says hard work is a "white" trait is off their rocker.  So yeah... There's been a lot. Much more, I'm sure, but I've only been paying attention not as long as I should have...* Okay but why mention your gender and ethnicity? Moreso to defeat the narrative that only straight white men support Trump. I saw some other posts about other women who voted Trump and it made me feel more included, especially since the "everyone on reddit is a guy" lol. I think seeing people you can relate to in a group makes you more likely to join or participate that group, and in the case of the two parties, if Democrats become aware they're losing their "core" base, one can hope they'll be forced to reposition themselves in a way that's more favorable to everyone.* You're a fake. No, I use alt accounts and delete my post history.  Believe what you want, no skin off my back.

If they popped you in the nose, does that make you a fascist?  This is how antifa wants it.  For too long, reddit has coddled its violent left-wing communities.  It's not The_Donald out there rioting, burning things and shooting people and cops.And we here on conservative subreddits have watched this happen for so long.  The scumbag left gets its share of tolerance, but the moment a poster here says, "If someone comes on my property and tries to harm me or my family, I will defend my home and loved ones..."  Someone hits the, "threatens or harasses" report reason.  But today there's a top post on the antifa subreddit.  And it's a hum dinger.  The revolutionary terrorists are mad that the President said that they are terrorists.  And they go on to SHOW us all that they ARE terrorists with "terrorist privilege".  I guess today is "tolerate a terrorist" day.  But any further tolerance of this is reddit tolerating terrorists every day.  Well *some* terrorists.This is a bit of a deep dive and it's a boring effort-post.  It's not a snappy meme or short article about things.  I hope you'll join me as I show you what we are dealing with, because I'm seeing boomer talking heads on TV saying, *"I have no idea where all of these miscreants on the streets came from!"*  That's because they've missed all the slicey boi Robespierre wannabes that have been calling for blood running down the streets of the USA for YEARS now.  That's right, that Dew-swilling, tendie muncher who used to satisfy him/herself by snidely typing "America delenda est" on the internet and using the Red World mod while playing Kaiserreich is on the streets now.And they WANT you to know who they are all while recoiling that the President said that they are a terrorist group.  The left was VERY KEEN to have the DOJ investigating "right-wing terror" in the USA.  They assured us that it's the only **legit** terror in the USA.  Otherwise why would the DOJ be investigating it?  Well, it's time for the spotlight of justice to shine on these left-wingers who want communist revolution and destruction.  Fair's fair, Che.  Time to pay attention to the psychos behind the soy curtain.Let's look first at [the original post on the antifa subreddit.](https://imgur.com/a/ohUdMfg)>I am an academic who teaches and studies the rise and fall of Fascism. I am literally anti-fascist by trade. Argument from authority.  "Guys, I literally teach this stuff!"  Yes, Karl, no one's shocked that academia is full of leftism.  We've known for awhile.  It doesn't make you any smarter than anyone else.  Of course, our beloved professor immediately brings up Hitler.  >"It became illegal to be associated with the Communist party. "I'm not a fan of commies.  Not a fan of Nazis, either.  I think the government needs eyeballs on anyone associated with either of these political philosophies.  What about you?>Declaring the loose concept of being against Fascism to be terrorism is like what Hitler, did but skips several of the steps. We all know how it ends. We aren't even starting in February. We are starting in March.Trump isn't declaring the philosophy of "being against fascism" against the law.  If he was...most of our politicians would go to jail.  Because I can't think of any declared "fascist" among them.  Opposing communism isn't fascism.  It's common sense.>This man can't be allowed to stay in office. If he does. If this movement loses momentum. The people of the United States aren't the only ones who lose. Everyone loses. The world loses. (Our OP is going to make it clear later that he is calling for us to get rid of Trump *by any means*...)>Get out there. Get angry. Don't back down. For all our sakes. Please, don't back down.(We have riots happening.  This "professor" who spells center "centre" later on is egging on these riots.  Why is reddit allowing a foreigner to encourage rioting in the USA?)>Nixon resigned under protests, Mubarak was listed in Egypt after the Arab Spring, Marie Antoinette was beheaded and Mussolini was strung up by protestors at a gas station.>There's more than one way to skin a cat. Vote, but be ready when the election is an inevitable sham.#This is **inexcusable** reddit.  #Ban this subreddit, already.  This foreign professor is encouraging violent revolution and encouraging killing our President.  ENOUGH REDDIT!This is bad...yeah? But the comments DEVOLVE all of this further.  I will put the shots of ALL the comments at the end of the post, but let's just look at SOME of them.["We are all Jacobins when the last moderate falls. Revolution or death." "haha guillotine go zoom".](https://imgur.com/a/YbfmvHB)#It was called the "Reign of Terror" for a reason.  So when you are invoking it, don't be surprised when we all call you terrorists...[Fight fascism with people's war!  Elections no!  People's war yes!](https://imgur.com/a/TzGUnM8)This is a declaration of civil war.  And it's upvoted![Here's where they say that they are "good" with Stalin.  Making common cause with Stalinists is fine and, in fact, if you criticize Stalinists on the antifa subreddit your comment will be removed because you are "causing leftist infighting."](https://imgur.com/a/0KrsZ4t)["Biden is not anti-fascism."](https://imgur.com/a/wZvpx5Z)These people will not even be satisfied if Biden wins.  Do you understand yet?  It's not TRUMP that they oppose at all.  They oppose capitalism.  They are upset that Biden's campaign doesn't embrace socialism.  These are not anti-fascists...these are violent left-wing revolutionaries and they are announcing as much while also pretending to be offended that the nation has noticed.[RED FOREVER!  STAY STRONG COMRADES!](https://imgur.com/a/RMUuSzo)You think this is a larp, but that account has a three year history of posting lefty shit on reddit.[This is very important.  Here is our OP noting that Trump was "taken to a bunker" and saying that he's NOT "talking about voting."  Our OP...is encouraging the masses to take out Trump...and if this isn't getting dodgy enough...](https://imgur.com/a/IB56SUk)[Another poster says, "Assassination is always an option..."](https://imgur.com/a/PAA0W2K)This comment is still there and has been up for two hours now.#So reddit, are you good with all of this?

Social media has become toxic these days - with friends posting things to support the black lives matter movement. I agree with the motive of this movement, but it just feels like everyone is hopping on this bandwagon just to feel like they’re contributing and because it’s trending now. I’m seeing posts from people saying things like “we see you people who aren’t posting anything on social media. We see that you dont care about black lives or anything going on now.”  But like what are YOU doing? You’re sitting on your lazy ass shaming other people while there are REAL people protesting and trying to make a change. Sharing a facebook post isn’t contributing to shit, sorry for my language. I’m so sick and tired of this leftist elite culture and that you HAVE to be a certain way to be accepted by them. The left is supposed to be the most “accepting and encouraging” environment, yet they so easily punish their own friends for NOT POSTING A BLACK SQUARE OR MORE ON SOCIAL MEDIA? Sorry but this makes me so mad and I’m sure others are too. The left is so good at guilt shaming others for not following the trends. I considered myself a democrat/ left leaning for so many years. These recent events were the last straw for me. Seeing how the democratic party is taking advantage of its voters once again during election year is appalling. I’m sick and tired of the bullshit left and my eyes are opened. Yours truly,Newly registered Florida Republican

I left home in my teens to live with an older sibling who has a long term(which was not diagnosed at that time) autoimmune disorder and had just given birth to her eldest child. For half a year I stayed home and tended her child while she attended university(homeschooled myself during this time.), then she went to live in another state to continue attending school and it was just me, the child, and their father. I went to high school, and worked part time, and helped raise this child for another year. I ADORE this child, and she adores me, but this experience dealing with her parents made me realize very early in life that I didn't want children of my own. I feel like her parents were very entitled, selfish, and ultimately abusive to both me and my niece.**This experience basically made me NEVER want to be dependent upon anyone ever again** and I saw that getting into most relationships, pursuing most career goals put me into this position, regardless of what I was bringing to the table. I basically started working and haven't really stopped since then.Despite struggling, I'm pretty much able to get by because I've always been willing to work hard and I don't have any children it's just me, but I've not really thrived. I worked a lot of jobs in various industries but I've not moved up in income or title. There was a time when I considered university education(mainly because that's what was pushed to me.) Now I'm seriously considering trade school if I do decide to further my education.  I did consider and dismiss both joining the armed services and pursuing a CDL license simply because, as I said, I am a single woman, and I did not trust going off somewhere far away from my male relatives around a bunch of strange men who don't have regular access to women. Seems like a recipe for...basically all of the sexual assault/harassment you hear about women in those environments experiencing and I've never been willing to take that chance.  Same thing with marriage or romantic relationships. I basically know that I'm not a position that society respects or values( even some of my own family members have shown me this.) and I don't trust any strangers to protect my interests/safety like I will. And I'm not going to be stupid enough to put myself in a position that I can't get out of by myself. Experience has basically proved me right in this regard since ALL of the women I know personally who followed these paths did experience/are experiencing both sexual assault/harassment/abuse in addition to the career/economic benefits. More power to them, just could not be me. I'm sure they feel the same about my life. So it is what it is.I don't think I've ever really had personal politics, at least I didn't recognize them as such, until I moved to a different region of the United States. I moved from the Midwest, a very conservative part of the Midwest, to very "liberal" NYC. Mainly to pursue my own personal interests which are easier to do here than where I was living. I experienced culture shock. Which I expected but not in the ways/areas I experienced it.These are just my experiences in regards to Liberals VS Conservatives and why one state which is supposedly so prejudiced and Conservative was actually more accepting and progressive than the Liberal one.**Liberals LIE. All the time. For no reason, or any reason.** This makes them very hard to deal with on a day to day to basis. And I'm quite personally at a point where I'm fed up with it. For one thing, the lies just get compounded over time(because actions have consequences.) and since they never own up to them, the consequences of said lies are never dealt with get worse over time. Being an honest person here is basically like being an adult in a world full of small children. Conservatives get angry when you lie to them, whereas Liberals get angry when you tell them the truth. I'm DEAD serious here. It can be over something trivial or something serious but try having an honest discussion with a Liberal about anything, not even something political. At best it will end in some emotional outburst, at worst they will try to attack you in some way, at some point simply because you said or thought something they disagreed with. Which brings me to my next point**Liberals are ALL ABOUT CONTROL. They are just naturally TYRANNICAL.** I don't like saying that it's their belief system, but it is. Conservatives simply draw boundaries about what they will and won't do or accept. Liberals don't accept anything that doesn't align with their beliefs, even if their beliefs/or what they are based on is proven wrong. I'm gonna bring up the elephant in the room: The Pandemic. I pointed out to someone that Sweden hasn't instituted lockdowns, or mask mandates and their Covid Infection rates aren't any worse than any other country in Europe. The answers that I got were, "You don't know that." Even after I showed articles that said this very thing. Then it was, "Its a very small country." Which has nothing to do with the supposed communicability of this disease. Then it was, "Well Swedish people are more healthy." Which honestly speaks to my experience. Every person I know who was infected with Covid-19 had a preexisting condition. It was only five people for me but still. I'm hardly a picture of health but due to my "deplorable" status the jobs I do require a lot of physical labor and I try to eat healthy and don't drink or smoke. So I don't lead a sedentary lifestyle and Precovid I did actually try to go to the gym. But I still deal with health issues most of my illnesses seem to come on from stress and lack of sleep which I recognize as a lifestyle choice. Lifestyle CHOICES. **Masks will not protect you from those.** If you drink soda all day, and never eat vegetables and already have some type of disorder and then get a completely unnecessary vaccination during a pandemic...I'm kinda not surprised you came down with Covid-19. If you're a heavy smoker and lead a sedentary lifestyle...I'm kinda not surprised you got diagnosed with Covid-19. But it's the elephant in the room to even point out that not everyone seems to be at equal risk for catching this disease. Because that would be thinking independently and coming to unpleasant conclusions about things like...obesity or the standard American/Western diet/lifestyle that tends to lead to/worsen obesity/chronic illnesses. So...everyone just wear the masks, even though in the beginning of the pandemic we told you not to, and social distance. Meanwhile you can still drink liquor and buy cigarettes and purchase sex from sex workers/have casual sex, but don't you dare go to church or school! It just doesn't make sense and it's clearly about controlling people to create **a feeling of safety** rather than actually making things safe. I didn't expect this to be this long. Sorry!  But those are probably the two main things. But there are SO MANY more. Its just been adding up. I don't want to get longwinded(even though I have) so I'll just end it here. One of my personal core values is HONESTY. And I really can't abide lying, or liars. I just can't. And I KNOW when I'm being lied to and I don't care how forcefully or vigorously the liar persists. At a certain point you realize who/what you're dealing with and you just stop engaging them and move in silence and I think this election...you're going to witness that.

But that’s not how our elections work, and the two-party system is the system we have to work with. There are no moral or emotional victories in protest voting or abstaining from voting; not when migrant children are sleeping in cages at the border, not when back-door deals are made to pad the pockets of the ultra-rich, not when taxpayers are strapped with paying for golfing trips and military parades, not when the makeup of the Supreme Court is at stake, and not when vital agency positions are given to players hell-bent on tearing down the very functions and foundations of our government. Unless you can convince yourself that you are fine with these things happening, it is disingenuous and hurtful to throw your vote away to “prove a point.” Voting out Trump means voting for WHOEVER the Dem candidate running against him is.

Four years ago, my mother was an obnoxious Trump supporter. So obnoxious in fact that I had to go low contact with her for the first few months following election day and had considered cutting off contact for about a year because she was constantly throwing his win in my face and seemed to deliberately pick fights around Trump and politics.Well, about 2ish year ago her tune began to change. She said that Trump needed to stop tweeting so much and that he was just constantly sounding like an ass. Slowly but surely she actually seemed to start to dislike the man and was almost as disturbed by the things he said than I was. She eventually said that she just wasn't going to vote at all and I pointed out to her periodically through our conversations the kind of destructive things he was doing, regardless if she agreed with Biden or his policies.Well, this morning she seemed to make a sudden turn I never expected. She said she was tired of the division that Trump was causing in the country and the hate he was constantly spouting and the only way to stop him was to vote against him. She is going to vote for Biden.Wow. I never thought it would happen and I thought she would be grasping onto this life raft for the rest of her life until she drowned in the stupidity that Trump seems to represent and attract. But I can proudly say that she didn't let political party history influence her or refuse to admit when she was wrong. So proud!

0,Trump's congressional allies are waging open and all out warfare on F.B.I. to free him from the Russia investigation which is about to conclude with a conviction of their president for total "Obstruction of Justice" on 32 counts. Go figure !,406,8via7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/8via7p/trumps_congressional_allies_are_waging_open_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/8via7p/trumps_congressional_allies_are_waging_open_and/,1530563805.0,Yes, as per an article in today's NYT called "Trump's Rage Junkies" by Charles Blow, the famed columnist has reminded us once again that the Republicans in congress are thoroughly frustrated and totally desperate to end the Russia inquiry right now instead of before the end of September which everyone believes will happen.For these crooked Republican congress members that timing will be completely lethal for their chances of salvaging any votes in the upcoming midterm elections to be held all over America on November 6th.So no wonder these wretched and low life Americans from the right are doing everything in their power to scuttle the Russia inquiry by yelling, ridiculing and cussing Rod Rosenstein, a Republican whom Trump appointed as the Deputy Attorney General.And when Mr. Rosenstein is trying to do the right thing to allow Mr. Mueller, another Republican appointed by the Republicans in congress, to finish his inquiry which already nailed 16 Trump campaign connected individuals for corruption and lying to the F.B.I., Republican house member Trey Gowdy of South Carolina lashed out at our Deputy AG saying "Finish the hell up" as per the same article by Mr. BlowBut the main theme of Mr. Blow's article was Trump's ultra racist behaviors.As we've all seen by now that Trump who unlike most of us, became a total racist from his childhood.And it was quite easy for Trump to be racist because the way Trump's father Fred Trump filled up the brain of a young Trump with stories of how he harassed and lynched young and old Black folks with the help of his friends, when all of them were members in KKK.So it's no wonder that Trump grew up being a total racist human being without any remorse.He also won his election without being apologetic for uttering all the nasty words that he used to be popular among his thoroughly racist followers who helped him in getting elected because they thought they found their long lost messiah.Living in the countryside without any proper schools and no colleges,his White hard core supporters were always burning with desires to topple a government which was turning diverse right in front of their eyes.Trump who studied these racist Americans' behaviors for quite some time realized that given a few words against Mexicans,Muslims and Black and Brown immigrants coming from Haiti and other African countries,the countries he referred to as "shithole" countries and quickly denied saying that, so that he could turn the Democrats attending that meeting as liars.Actually he does all that with a wink to his White Supremacists supporters living nomadic lifestyles in their countryside not having traveled further than the Tennessee river or the mountain valley pipeline surrounding the Appalachian Trail.Since his followers never set their foot in any other country and will never do, those White Americans turn into White Nationalists only because of their ignorance.
0,Only way to beat Trump it's just stop speaking his name and just say the Republican party or GOP for any relevant policies. This marks the last time I use his name until after the next election.

The only way that we stop this man's agenda or stop him being reelected in 2020, is to stop printing his name in mainstream media and start discussing his policies as part of the current GOP or Republican party. I mean that we have to stop printing, saying, covering his every stupid word and thought.He got elected based on people just repeating his name over the years on tv and no substance. He is now a cult personality of name and nothing else. We know that he can lie cheat and do whatever he wants and his followers don't care so we have to make him irrelevant in order to continue with the Democratic process.So we have to stop covering every single dumb shit thing he says and just package it in with part of the Republican plan for the country and instead focus the media on Democratic candidates and what they are doing and what their policies are and avoid the actual name at all costs.This is some Voldemort level shit I understand however I honestly think this is the best way to defeat him permanently and swiftly.Stop with the name, stop with the brand, stop giving a fuck about him and focus on someone else. Your local senator for example is the best place to start and keep printing stories on them.Focus on your local people, let's talk about anyone and everything else, just... No more of that name.

The slightest hope of winning being replaced by the feeling of potentially being apart of one the greatest political upsets in American history as the night went on and state by state Trump's chances of winning the presidency increased. I remember the unfamiliar restrained political commentary of the Fox News Election Night team slowly turning more and more confident, and at the same time more and more familiar. I remember the rush of joy I experienced when Trump was called the winner, the exhilaration was so great you would have thought I had won the presidency myself. I also remember the days that followed and the creeping sense of despair and dread that had began to pester underneath the surface. I remember donating the Trump/Pence 2020 shirt that my mom got me to goodwill, not wanting to wear it anymore. I remember reality set in. In the coming weeks, I had begun to realize my views did not fit in with anything Trump said. My views didn't actually fit in with the Fox News crew's views. My views were as far from Republican as they could be. My views had no place in the Republican Party, truly, they never did. I was Pro-Choice throughout high school, arguing that nobody had the right to police what others chose to do with their bodies. I was pro gay marriage, arguing that it was nobody's business to determine whether or not it was okay for those of the same sex to love each other. Love is love, why does it matter? I asked. I believed that African Americans were being treated unfairly in America, and believed that racism was very much alive, if not emboldened, despite the election of Obama. I believed in Immigrant rights, hated the idea of the wall, and despised the bully tactics Trump used against Hillary. And yet, I still voted for him. I still caved into what I had been taught by my grandpa growing up, that the Democrats were the enemy and that the Republicans the heroes, no matter who that Republican was. I have since changed my party, and am now registered as a Democrat. I have since found a home for me and my views. I have since changed where I get my news from Fox to the "failing" NYT, "fake" CNN, and "biased" Atlantic. I regret the decision I made in 2016 to vote for Trump, but it did teach me one thing. It taught me which party I truly belonged to. Long Story Short: Due to being indoctrinated at a young age by my family (mainly my grandpa who I still love of course) and due to watching Fox News almost daily with my Grandpa, I had a twisted sense of what was right and what was wrong. I was a Republican because I thought I was SUPPOSED to be a Republican. I thought the Republicans were the party of honesty and of God. I thought the Republicans were the good guys and that the Democrats were evil fakes. I know now how wrong I was and I am sorry for the small part I played in getting us to where we are now.

If the latter happens, **Bernie Sanders** becomes **Chairman** of the **Senate Budget Committee**.Republicans are *fucking terrified* of that prospect, and every Democrat should be proportionally excited by it.  This election is not just about stopping catastrophe - it is an opportunity to really accomplish something amazing.  The power of the Senate Budget Committee over funding of US government institutions is enormous.No one as progressive as Sanders has *ever* been Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.  I defy anyone to find an example.  And it is within reach, folks.  Turn out to vote!!

0,Trump has got exactly 6 days to enjoy before his presidency will be in serious trouble. With Mueller's damning report about to be handed to the Dems in the House, Trump should think more about closing his own door than closing the border with Mexico.,188,aal5d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/aal5d4/trump_has_got_exactly_6_days_to_enjoy_before_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/aal5d4/trump_has_got_exactly_6_days_to_enjoy_before_his/,1546118290.0,With 50+ subpoenas already sent to the White House by Democrat Elijah Cummings, the Chair-Elect of the House Oversight Committee, Trump should be more concerned about how he'll wriggle himself out of this riddle of staying out of jail for possible collusion with Russia than closing the border with Mexico for lack of $5 billion from U.S. taxpayers that he always said in his campaign, " Mexico will pay for it." We also heard him saying something like this in all his campaigns, " Yes, as your president, I'll force Mexican govt. to pay for that damn wall, be sure about that."And now with neither the congress nor Mexico is ready to pay him the money for the wall, part of which may end up in his campaign coffers, Trump is hellbent on demanding the same money again and again from the leaders of the Democratic party in Congress.That is exactly what Annie Karni and Nicholas Fandos wrote in their Op-Ed in NYT today titled, "Trump Threatens to Close Border If Congress Won't Fund Wall."Adding my own views to their reporting, I've to say that either Trump doesn't remember or he has no intention to believe that the two Dem leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi told him pointblank in the White House two weeks back that they'd not pay any money for the wall but only for the border security personnel.To which, we all remember hearing Trump making the following pledges on national tv, "I'll then shut down the govt. And I'll take the blame for it. Be sure that I'll not put the blame on you two."So now with our government remaining in a shutdown mode, Trump is one step away from turning this country into one of those third world countries where the government hardly functions.On the contrary, if he really wants this country to function like the way it used to function before he came into power, he should stop thinking about how to win his next election.Yes, I strongly believe that Trump should start mitigating the pains of the federal workers who'd been furloughed for no fault of their own last week in the latest closure of all the non-emergency government agencies.And if he thinks that his first two years of office was a cakewalk, Trump should compare the next two years of his presidency with walking on fire.With Mr. Mueller's report about to hit the capitol with the loudest noises we've ever heard in our lifetime, Trump will be lucky to finish the first month of the next year as a president before the Republicans in congress force him to resign just like what they did with Nixon in 1974.

The GOP was ever-bitter about the New Deal, about America's strong labor unions, and increasingly (and ironically, given its 19th century history) Civil Rights.  They craved power but could only chip away at the towering American society they despised.But then came Ronald Reagan, proudly contemptuous of this nation's achievements and values, and substituting in their place a bunch of hollow taxidermist rhetoric.  Democrats worked with him despite his nuttery, but it was not mutual.George HW Bush followed.  Democrats worked with him - it was not mutual either.  But seemingly to their own surprise, Democrats retook the White House from HW Bush, and waited for Republicans to work with the Clinton administration.  Nope.  It was all-out propaganda war from Day One.They blocked appointments by default, spewed unhinged lies through their radio monopolies, and brainwashed their followers to the point where their cultist disciples believed simultaneously that Bill Clinton was (1)a feckless hippie and (2)a raving Communist maniac on the verge of sending the ATF to Waco them.The loss of 18 soldiers in Somalia was treated as a greater scandal than when Reagan threw away 200 Marines in Beirut - a scandal that barely anyone remembers because Democrats had stood for American interests over partisan gain.Republicans spent $90 million in taxpayer dollars on a vast, sweeping investigation of every aspect of every life with even the remotest connection to Bill Clinton and found...nothing.  But then years later an intern blew him, so IMPEACHMENT!  Bill's blowjob right up there with Nixon's attempt to overthrow the republic.But then they rigged a presidential election in 2000, committed more crimes than can be counted in a reasonably-sized post - including torture and starting a war that killed 5,000 Americans - but they refused to even investigate it.  Democrats were completely shut out of it all, and yet even then they were cooperating with these lawless pigs. Democratic leaders were using words like "misguided" to describe fucking WAR CRIMES for which enemy generals had been hanged by Allied tribunals in WW2.  They were STILL acting as if they had a partner in government in the GOP, despite constant proof - not evidence, absolute PROOF - to the contrary.Then Obama is President and the GOP reverses course 180 degrees yet again.  From "it's not illegal if the President does it," they reverted to the "destroying the Democrat is more important than serving America" that they held under Bill Clinton.  Most unhinged campaign of hate ever waged and yet virtually zero scandals held.  Now they won't even investigate an open traitor who is in blatant violation of even the most plainly-stated rules of the US Constitution.  Ladies and gentlemen, **there is no Republican Party**.  There is no group of political ideas with that label any longer.  There is a hate group and a criminal syndicate that does not believe in or support the concept of laws, or facts, or rights, and that is what's left of the GOP.They do not recognize your right to exist, to vote, to speak, to do anything they have not commanded you to do in their own interests.  They are tyrants with no redeeming value, and they have zero worth in this country any longer.Democrats in office, start governing like you are what you already know you are: What remains of a law-abiding government in the United States of America.And start treating Republicans like what they are: Nihilistic insurgents and vultures tearing at America's flesh, sneering at America's suffering, and longing for the day when there is no longer a free country looming over them making them feel as inadequate and unworthy as they are.There is no longer any room for appeasement, and no more time for umpteenth-chances for America's internal antagonists.  Republicans chose sides against this country a long time ago, now just fucking fight them.And what's more, fight to win.  As if you understand that your own careers are the least of what's at stake.

0,Trump by sending his son-in-law's sister to go to China and sell new condos in New Jersey for $500,000 to the Chinese people under the controversial EB-5 program he extended on the same evening,proved that he'll not stop milking the presidency for him and his extended families.,185,6a4zaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/6a4zaw/trump_by_sending_his_soninlaws_sister_to_go_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/6a4zaw/trump_by_sending_his_soninlaws_sister_to_go_to/,1494360381.0,Ever since Trump set his foot in the White House, he coveted himself and his family members with billions of dollars of windfall by mixing his presidency with his Trump Inc. or Trump Org. or by whatever name you can call this thing of gaming the system just to enrich him and his extended families to the point of no return. His screwing up of our political system came to a new horizon when he told his son-in-law Jared Kushner's sister to head first to China and talk about upcoming new apartments in affluent New Jersey towns with the money to be furnished at a rate of 4% interest under the EB-5 program instead of 16% that are being charged by our banks and other lending institutions as per 2 articles in today's NYT.And to most of these 8,000 affluent Chinese people who were already coming to the U.S.A. by paying $500,000 for visa with very scant scrutiny of their sources of money by our Homeland Security Dept.,Trump's son-in-law's sister pitched her never to be completed Condos and business projects in very affluent and expensive New Jersey towns with only 15 minutes drive from New York.And the ultra rich Chinese people forked out very easily those $500,000 fees for the same program which Trump extended with an Executive Order in the same evening up to September of this year, after Jared Kushner's sister was already present in the packed Hotel ballroom in Beijing just about ready to start her pitch of selling to the Chinese citizens about how to get the U.S. Citizenship with hardly any background checks just like many of their peers did before by forking out $500,000 each under the very highly critical EB-5 program.This very controversial program which two Senators want to be scrapped as it didn't do it's main purpose which was to help our distressed towns' people with employment opportunities for at least 10 unemployed American citizens in the totally neglected towns and cities.But instead of doing just that Trump's family members and other builders are gerimandering the towns and cities to include only the rich enclaves in the system to build highly expensive condos and apartments which was never the intention when this program was introduced in 1990.Just the fact that Trump and his extended family members are trying to build highly expensive apartments and expensive businesses in very affluent New Jersey towns employing hardly any poor people, shows very clearly to us all about the length to which Trump and his family members will go to make a fast buck in the range of $50 million by taking full advantage of his power of the presidency . It should be pointed out here that Jared Kushner's sister Ms. Nicole Meyer even used her brother's name and his position and high influence in the White House to sell her pitch along with the picture of his father in law to prove his blessings for the project by repeatedly showing Trump's picture on a huge projection screen in the same Ballroom to bolster her presentation.In other words she told the attendees in that room that her brother's father-in-law Trump the current president sitting in the White House's Oval room is totally involved in this scam.And lo and behold, before she could even open her mouth she collected promises with advance money in the range of $50 million total from each of her two pitches first in Beijing and then in Shanghai from those Chinese people who want to settle in the United States with their illegal loot from China the country where they could be languishing in jails for making money from illegal sources and also for not paying any taxes on their illegal and scam filled businesses with undeclared income just like what Trump is doing here in U.S. So as we're watching this terrible 'conflict of interest' that Trump is engaging sitting in the White House, we can only look at his presidency with awe as to how a President could use his bully pulpit to make gazillions of dollars by just twisting or extending the laws and regulations that can only help him and his extended family's interests.So if he really gets his wish of continuing to be the president for 8 years for which he already submitted the paperwork for 2020 presidential election, there will be no other billionaires on this earth who can surpass or even touch his wealth portfolio ever.With 382+ registered businesses registered in his name in 60+ different countries of this world with another 100+ businesses that he's operating in his buddies and family members' names, his very high stake gamble of winning the presidency by screwing up the minds of innocent and vulnerable poor White citizens of this country whom he promised in all his campaign stops that if he ever became the president with their votes, he'd create jobs only for them first by putting their interests first before his billionaire buddies.But now with his bunch of billionaire buddies in his cabinet and his followers still without jobs because of his reluctance to close down his businesses in poor countries, its high time his voters wake up from their slumber and face the reality that they've been duped by this con man and the snake oil salesman.Yes, if his followers still do not realize that they've been taken for a ride, then only God can help them.Not Trump.Who to my mind and many other citizens of this country will be the first Trillionaire of this world if we allow him to continue to function as the president of our great country any longer.Impeachment is the only way our politicians can stop this menace to our societies.

Additionally, health experts suspect new waves of the virus to come through (they could be wrong). That means the likelihood is the elections in November will be altered dramatically. Mail in voting will be the best option available but a reeling post office won’t be able to deliver so the Trump administration and congress will move to keep in person voting thus crippling turnout except for this among us that believe this is a hoax (largely Trump supporters) and ensuring another four years of this garbage.

0,Reminder to Democrats, it’s not enough to vote for Joe Biden. You have to enthusiastically support him through the campaign, or you’ll cost him more votes than the one you give him, just like Hillary in 2016.,155,i5nwli,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/i5nwli/reminder_to_democrats_its_not_enough_to_vote_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/i5nwli/reminder_to_democrats_its_not_enough_to_vote_for/,1596869189.0,In 2016, many liberal Americans voted for Hillary Clinton but also spent the whole election complaining about her, talking trash about her, saying she was just as bad as Trump, calling her lesser of two evils, saying “we’re screwed no matter who wins” ......only to then be shocked when Donald Trump won. That’s because these voters cost Hillary more votes than the one they gave her.I’ve been seeing some of this mentality about Joe Biden ever since it became clear he was going to be the nominee. Liberals and Democrats have been complaining about him, saying they’ll vote for him, but they’re not crazy about him or how they’ll settle for him. It’s not as bad as with Hillary, but it’s still there.I do not give a damn if Joe Biden is not the ideal candidate for you. I don’t care if you hate him with the passion of a thousand burning suns. You still vote for him, and you enthusiastically support him through the campaign. Why? Because no matter how less than perfect Biden is, he is still INFINITELY better than Trump. I wasn’t crazy about Hillary in 2016 either, but I still gladly voted for her and encouraged as many people as I could to vote for her. Why? Because I wasn’t really thinking about her. I was thinking more about the millions of underprivileged and marginalized Americans who would have benefitted tremendously from her progressive policies, which is the same reason I’m gladly voting for Biden. It’s fine if you don’t like him, but you don’t get to claim that you support and care about underprivileged people while also complaining about the candidate whose policies will help them.So if you’re voting for Biden, do not also spend the whole election complaining about him and still expect him to win.

For the longest time I thought I was a liberal. I thought liberals cared about people and were logical, that's not the case in my experience. As soon as George Floyd died any piece of logic the liberal party had left was thrown into the wind. These people don't want to solve problems they want to blame people. My father's dad was a  black man who grew  up in Arkansas, he encountered racism and it never slowed him down, he never used it as an excuse. He was a Korean war veteran and after his duty, he worked and provided for his family. He made enough to buy a house and send my father to private school. He made something for himself during the time when it was hard as a black man to do so.When I see black people today crying racism,  it mocks my grandfather, my grandmother and every single person who worked to show America that blacks are equal. Now being equal isn't enough. We demand special treatment from the police i.e. Nothing should happen to us if we try to escape arrest because racist cops! Corporations and celebrities treat us like small brain proto-humans who can't take a blackface joke and even the Democratic Presidential nominee feels he can decide who is black or not based on who they vote for in the election. I am so sick of this BS. Black people have it better than ever before, but we continue to play victim and ask for handouts that destroy us. Single parent homes are the number one threat that is tearing the black community apart. No one says this on television no one wants to be viewed as a racist. It's sad. The men  in my life taught me to work for things, to never make excuses and to critically think. If I didn't have them in my life I probably would be marching and living a lie. 73% of black kids are born out of wedlock. Kids need adults in their life to teach them morals and values. People praise single mothers but should we be? These are adults who make decisions and then we as a country have to pay for these decisions not in just taxes, but our societal foundation. We enable single moms to keep having kids, those kids grow up without moral character and they perpetuate the cycle.EDITThanks for the comments and medals. I wrote this in a burst of frustration after months of feeling more than a little irritated about BLM. Wish I worded it a bit better, explained somethings, but I'm not going to, thanks guys and gals. I appreciate it.

1,Why are you guys so civil when it comes to discussing Politics? I thought you guys were supposed to be nuts.,3842,jmdeq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jmdeq5/why_are_you_guys_so_civil_when_it_comes_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jmdeq5/why_are_you_guys_so_civil_when_it_comes_to/,1604305480.0,I'm a Canadian lurker when it comes to the US election. I've been browsing this sub and r/politics. It blows my mind how much of an echo chamber r/politics is. Anyone who supports the Right, no matter how minimumly, is downvoted, insulted, and probably receive nasty DMs.They refer to r/conservative from time to time, saying they're losing their minds over there, they're delusional or whatever.I have seen a lot of civil discussion here. Even when disregarding the left or Biden, you guys don't do it in an insulting way. Which is ironic because the people in r/politics would claim that's all the right does, and yet most of what I see is the complete opposite. It appears that the people who support Trump, or Conservatives, or republicans, get attacked constantly. I don't understand why anybody should be insulted for their political views, no matter what side they're on. Anyway I guess what I'm saying is, keep it up guys. I've been lurking this sub for the last month, and I feel like I have a different perspective about Conservatives than I did before I came here. You guys are not as nuts as the media and r/politics makes you guys out to be. That is all.
